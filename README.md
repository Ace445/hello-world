# hello-world

Hello fellow GitHub users!
Since this is my first taste of GitHub, I have been tasked with building a "hello-world" repository and editing the obligatory README file. So here goes:

I am a novice programmer interested in building my own fork of CyanogenMod 14.1 (perhaps a bit too ambitious for someone of my level).
I have limited experience with C++, C#, and Java. Conveniently, those are 3 out of the 4 programming languages that make up Android.
Unfortunately for me, Java makes up the bulk of Android, and I'm not too fond of Java. But, nontheless, I look forward to experimenting with the AOSP/CyanogenMod.
