# hello-world

Hello fellow GitHub users!
Since this is my first taste of GitHub, I have been tasked with building a "hello-world" repository and editing the obligatory README file. So here goes:

I am a novice programmer currently learning the fundamentals of C#, thanks to Scott Lilly's guide on building a simple RPG game.
I have also dabbled with C++ and the Win32 API to better understand how Microsoft Windows works on a lower level. However, I don't plan on getting serious with C++. I just like to experiment with the Win32 API occasionally.

At some point, I would like to invest some time into learning how to build a UWP app for Windows 10. It’s more for curiosity’s sake than a desire to build and publish an app on the Windows Store.

Anyway, that’s it for now. If you took the time to read this entire bio: thank you! You must have quite a bit of free time on your hands.
